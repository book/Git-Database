=item repository

The local Git repository, as managed by B<git>.

=item backend

A class doing the L<Git::Database::Role::Backend> role.

It manages all interactions with the Git repository, via its L<store>.
A backend instance is always connected to a store instance.

The backend interface is split across several roles, each
requiring one or more access methods to be defined. The
roles are: L<Git::Database::Role::Backend> (this is
the minimum required role that a class must do to be
considered a backend), L<Git::Database::Role::ObjectReader>,
L<Git::Database::Role::ObjectWriter>, L<Git::Database::Role::RefReader>
and L<Git::Database::Role::RefWriter>.

=item store

The Perl Git wrapper that reads and write the data from and to the repository.

A store instance is always connected to an actual Git repository.

=item object

An object from the Git object database. Represented in Perl by the
L<Git::Database::Object::Blob>, L<Git::Database::Object::Tree>,
L<Git::Database::Object::Commit> and L<Git::Database::Object::Tag>
classes.

=item ref

A reference (tag or branch) in the Git repository.
