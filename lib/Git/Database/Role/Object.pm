=head1 NAME

Git::Database::Role::Object - Role for objects from the Git object database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Git::Database::Object::Blob;

    use Moo;

    with 'Git::Database::Role::Object';

    sub kind { 'blob' }

    1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Git::Database::Role::Object provides the generic behaviour for all
L<Git::Database> objects obtained from or stored into the Git object
database.

When creating a new object meant to be added to the Git object database
(via L<backend>), only the L</content> attribute is actually required.

New objects are typically created via L<Git::Database::Role::ObjectReader>'s
L<get_object|Git::Database::Role::ObjectReader/get_object> method,
rathen than by calling C<new> directly. This is when the object data is
fetched from the Git object database.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The L<content>, L<size> and L<digest> attribute are lazy, and can be
computed from the others: L<size> from L<content>, L<content> from
L<digest> (if the object exists in the backend store), and L<digest>
from L<content>. All attributes have a predicate method.

Additional attributes in some classes may add other ways to compute
the content.

Creating a new object with inconsistent C<kind>, C<size>,
C<content> and C<digest> attributes can only end in
tears. This is also true for additional attributes such as
L<directory_entries|Git::Database::Object::Tree/directory_entries>,
L<commit_info|Git::Database::Object::Commit/commit_info>, and
L<tag_info|Git::Database::Object::Tag/tag_info>.

For now, as soon as the L</content> of a Git::Database::Role::Object is
needed, it is fully loaded in memory.

=head2 backend

A L<Git::Database::Role::Backend> from which the object comes from
(or will be stored into). It is typically used by the attribute builders.

If none is provided, a L<Git::Database::Backend::None> is used, which
is only able to compute the L<digest>.

=head2 content

The object's actual content.

=head2 size

The size (in bytes) of the object content.

=head2 digest

The SHA-1 digest of the object, as computed by Git.

If set at creation time, it is internally converted to lowercase.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 as_string

Return a string representation of the content.

By default, this is the same as C<content()>, but some classes may
override it.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 kind

Returns the object "kind".

In Git, this is one of C<blob>, C<tree>, C<commit>, and C<tag>.
